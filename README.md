This program will automatically find and rename each episode of a series

It uses wikipedia information so sometime the list of episode name might
not be right or empty due to different format.

I'm currently working to implement it for series without season
eg: anime

The output format will be has following:
    'series name' -SXXEXX- 'title'.'ext'

It's been tested on the following Series:
  - Adventure Time
  - Breaking Bad
  - Community
  - How I Met your mother

Note:
  - It does not work for Doctor Who as the structure of the page is
    different from other series
