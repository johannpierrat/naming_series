This program will automatically find and rename each episode of a series

It uses wikipedia information so sometime the list of episode name might
not be right or empty due to different format.

I'm currently working to implement it for series without season
eg: anime

It's been tested on the following Series:
  - Adventure Time
  - Breaking Bad
  - Community
  - How I Met your mother
